# memorize-front-end

Memorize is a web app that I created to learn the MERN stack. It is a flashcard tool (like Quizlet) that allows you to create and save flashcard sets. Features a login system with password security via bcrypt and with session tokens via json-web-tokens. The user dashboard features all of your flashcard sets, and allows you to add, modify, and delete them.

This repo holds all the front end code for the project.
